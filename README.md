# U-FISH ðŸŽ£

Unified, U-Net based, deep learning method for FISH spot detection, trained on diverse datasets.

The underlying concept of our method, U-FISH, acknowledges the significant variations in image background and signal spot features due to differences in experimental conditions, hybridization targets, and imaging parameters across various data sources. A single algorithm or parameter setting often falls short in accommodating all these image types. Therefore, we introduce an image-to-image U-Net model to enhance input images by suppressing background noise, eliminating post-enhancement noise, and normalizing the size of signal spots. We then apply conventional methods for spot detection on these enhanced images, thus achieving higher accuracy.

## Usage

```bash
pip install u-fish
```

API for inference and evaluation:

```python
from skimage import io
from ufish.api import UFish

ufish = UFish()
ufish.load_weights("path/to/weights")  # loading model weights
# or download from huggingface:
# ufish.load_weights_from_internet()

# inference
img = io.imread("path/to/image")
pred_spots = ufish.predict(img)

# plot prediction result
fig_spots = ufish.plot_result(img, pred_spots)

# evaluate
true_spots = pd.read_csv("path/to/true_spots.csv")
metrics = ufish.evaluate_result(spots, true_spots)

# plot evaluation result
fig_eval = ufish.plot_evaluation_result(
    img, pred_spots, true_spots, cutoff=3.0)
```

CLI usage:

```bash
# list all sub-commands:
$ python -m ufish.cli
NAME
    cli.py

SYNOPSIS
    cli.py COMMAND

COMMANDS
    COMMAND is one of the following:

     load_weights
       Load weights from a local file or the internet.

     plot_2d_eval
       Plot the evaluation result.

     plot_2d_pred
       Plot the predicted spots on the image.

     pred_2d_img
       Predict spots in a 2d image.

     pred_2d_imgs
       Predict spots in a directory of 2d images.

# predict one image
$ python -m ufish.cli pred_2d_img input.tiff output.csv

# predict all images in a directory
$ python -m ufish.cli pred_2d_imgs input_dir output_dir

# using --help to see details of each sub-command, e.g.:
$ python -m ufish.cli pred_2d_img --help
```
