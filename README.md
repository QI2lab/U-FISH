# U-FISH ðŸŽ£

Unified, U-Net based, deep learning method for FISH spot detection, trained on diverse datasets.

The underlying concept of our method, U-FISH, acknowledges the significant variations in image background and signal spot features due to differences in experimental conditions, hybridization targets, and imaging parameters across various data sources. A single algorithm or parameter setting often falls short in accommodating all these image types. Therefore, we introduce an image-to-image U-Net model to enhance input images by suppressing background noise, eliminating post-enhancement noise, and normalizing the size of signal spots. We then apply conventional methods for spot detection on these enhanced images, thus achieving higher accuracy.
